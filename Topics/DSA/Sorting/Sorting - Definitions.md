- **Sorting**: The process of arranging a collection of data items into a specific order based on a defined criterion

- **In-Place Sorting**: An algorithm that sorts data within its original data structure, using only a constant amount of extra memory

- **Stable Sorting**: A sorting algorithm that preserves the original relative order of items with equal values

- **Order Of Growth**: The order of growth provides a rough measure of the resources (e.g., time and memory) required by a computational process. This is known as computational complexity, which includes:
	• **Time complexity**: the amount of time taken by an algorithm as a function of input
	size.
	• **Space complexity**: the amount of memory space needed by an algorithm as a
	function of input size.

- **Big-O notation** is used to express the efficiency of an algorithm as input size increases
